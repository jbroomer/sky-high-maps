This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Sky High Maps is a Progressive Web App! What does that mean?

Google states that a PWA should be reliable, fast and engaging. While those are high-level requirements for a web app to be considered progressive, Google does provide an audit tool (called Lighthouse) that runs a series of tests to conclude if an app is truly progressive. 

Some lower level requirements checked by Lighthouse are:
- Responds with a 200 when offline. 
- Pages load quickly enough on mobile networks such as 3G.
- Uses HTTPS everywhere.
- Registers a service worker.
- Contains an app manifest with proper content.

All of the above requirements are met with Sky High Maps. Other components of the application such as an app theme, cached content and a custom splash screen make it so that the web app is not only a PWA, but it is PWA Optimized!
